## Project 1: Churn Prediction of bank customers
* Created a model that predicts whether a customer will churn (his/her balance will fall below minimum balance in the next quarter)
* Handled missing values using appropriate imputations
* Pre-processed data to make it modelling ready (one-hot encoding, skeweness treatment, outlier removal, scaling)
* Created baseline model to serve as an indicator of performance for other models (along with its confusion matrix, ROC-AUC on test data), with cross-validation
* Compared baseline against model having all features
* Compared baseline agaist model built using top 10 features obtained by Reverse Feature Elimination
